# ScanningApp
# ASP .NET MVC V6 + SQL SERVER + VISUAL STUDIO
MADE FOR AN EVENT TO CHECK THE PARTICIPANTS BADGES BY SCANNING THE QR CODE AND TE APP FETCHS IN DATA BASE TO SEE IF : 
  1-THE QR IS ALREADY SCANNED CAUSE YOU CANT LET PASS A PERSON WITH AN ALREADY SCANNED BADGE (DATE LAST SCAN =! NULL && QR EXIST)  
  2-THE QR IS SCANNED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE PARTICIPANT CAN ENTER EVENT SUCCESFULLY (DATE LAST SCAN == NULL && QR EXIST)
  3-THE QR DOESNT EXIST IN THE DATABSE 
DATABASE : USER ID + QR CODE + DATE LAST SCAN

I MADE THIS APP IN FEW HOURS IT WAS EASY TO MAKE, BUT DIDNT OUT MUCH EFFORT IN THE STYLIN GCAUSE IT WAS NOT REQUESTED Y THE CLIENT.
