  <strong>Made for an event to check the participants' badges by scanning the QR code. The app fetches data from the database to ensure:</strong>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The QR code is not scanned twice (Date Last Scan â‰  NULL && QR Exists).</li>
  <li>The QR code is scanned for the first time, allowing the participant to enter the event successfully (Date Last Scan == NULL && QR Exists).</li>
  <li>The QR code doesn't exist in the database, detecting unvalid Qr, not allowing participant to enter event.</li>
</ol>

## Functionality

The main functionalities of the application include:

1. **Scanning QR Codes:** Participants' badges are equipped with QR codes which are scanned using the application.

2. **Checking Database:** The application fetches data from the database to verify:

   - Whether the QR code has already been scanned, as a participant with a scanned badge should not be allowed to enter again.
   
   - If it's the first time the QR code is being scanned, allowing the participant to enter the event successfully.
   
   - Whether the QR code scanned don't exist in database "fake ", not allowing participant to enter the event.
